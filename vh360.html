<h2>Project: Online Casino Website</h2>
<h2>Upcoming Project: VH 360</h2>
<p><strong>Problem statement:</strong>With VH360°, we're looking to solve the problem of individuals losing touch with their high schools both during attendance and after they graduate. Core memories are formed during these years, and there should be a place to share, view, and reflect on them that's personalized to the specific school. What makes VH360° even more unique compared to popular social media sites is the fact that it's ad-free and isn't focused on content performance. It's simply an archive reserved for students, which must be proven using credentials. This gives it a school-centric, preservationist style.</p>
<p><strong>AI Integration:</strong>We plan to integrate AI into VH360° for content moderation. Our goal is to share appropriate, safe memories, and we intend to use a video analysis tool, like TensorFlow or Hugging Face Transformers. While neither of us have exprience with these tools, we believe this goal is feasible because of the tools' popularity and widespread documentation.</p>

    <h2>Project Development: Early Stages</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Progress and Challenges:</strong> This week we worked on our website's home page. We first got ourselves acquanted with figma then created a mock home page for our website on Figma, using the original Facebook website as inspiration. We started to transfer our Figma to code with builder.io and chat gpt, but ran into some issues with the css sizing with the code.

        <strong>Mentor Contact (No Mentor Yet):</strong> Hello Mentor, 
        My name is Jaewook Lee, a computer science student currently working on a project with my partner, Riley Mitchell. We are working on a website called VH360, designed for VHHS students to upload and view personal videos in a safe and engaging environment. 
        Key components of our project include, video uploads, video processing, sentiment analysis, recommendation system, and AI content moderation. 
        We are reaching out to you because we believe your experience in website development and AI/ML could provide valuable insights as we work on our project. Specifically, we would appreciate your guidance on the following questions:
        Do you have any tips for working as a team on a coding project?
        What are the best ways to upload videos to a simple website?
        Other than content moderation, how might you integrate AI or ML into our project?
        What would you consider to be the essential elements of a good website?
        How have you increased your efficiency when programming in the past, and how do you do so now?
        If you’re available for a conversation or meeting, we would love to discuss this in more detail. 
        Thank you for your time and consideration
        Best regards, 
        Jaewook Lee

        <strong>Week 6 updates: </strong> For this week, the website has been updated with a home page with a Google sign-on feature that has not yet been finished up. There is also a video page where we can embed videos from youtube. We're finding that uploading videos to youtube first then embedding into our site may be more suitable for hosting purposes.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Week 7 updates: </strong> This week we have made some progress on getting the login feature up and running. However, we still need a payment plan to get the feature working. A dashboard page has been added, but since it used information form the user's sign-in, it isn't quite fully functional due to the sign-in feature not entirely working yet. For the next week, we will be working on the sign-in feature and the dashboard in order to enhance user experience. Also we still need a mentor and will be working with Mr.Leuken to find one hopefully by the next week.

    <p><strong>Week 8 Progress:</strong> </p>
